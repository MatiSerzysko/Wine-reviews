In this repository, you can find Machine Learning project, created by me (sic!) and a few fellow students from University of Wroc≈Çaw.

Our goal was to create model, which aims to predict quality of wine based on various data about it. We tried many approches, among others XGBoost, Logistic Regression and more.
Except code, I'm sharing nice presentation, where we summarised our work and also data we used.

Enjoy!
